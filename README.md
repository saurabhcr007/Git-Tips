# Git-Tips

### Let start with what is git ?

<h5>Simply we can say</h5> ,  It is a tool that tracks and manages changes to computer files, allowing you to save different versions over time, collaborate with others on the same files, and easily switch between different stages of your work, like a time machine for your code.

### If you know what is git then you have also heard about git commands !

##### If not so lets talk about it
Git commands are like magic words that let you tell Git what to do. You use them to save your work, bring in changes from others, share your work, create different versions, mix them together, and copy other people's work. These words help you control Git and make your teamwork and time-traveling in files super easy!
